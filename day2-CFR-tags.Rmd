## Matthew 6:7-13

.smaller[
And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. This, then, is how you should pray:<br>
]
.small[
‘Our Father in heaven,<br>
hallowed be your name,<br>
your kingdom come,<br>
your will be done,<br>
    on earth as it is in heaven.<br>
Give us today our daily bread.<br>
And forgive us our debts,<br>
    as we also have forgiven our debtors.<br>
And lead us not into temptation,<br>
    but deliver us from the evil one.’ <br>

## Wright, p. 29 - 30

>> The ultimate future hope remains a surprise, partly because we don't know when it will arrive and partly because at present we have only images and metaphors for it, leaving us to guess that the reality will be far greater, and more surprising, still

## Closing in [prayer](https://www.prayerinstitute.com/prayer/a-prayer-of-appreciation-for-the-beauty-of-gods-creation-2/)
.small[
Holy Spirit, keep us always aware of how we treat the creation. Help us to find the amazement we once had as children when we look at the awesome beauty of our world. Show us, once again, the simple joys of walking barefoot on a sandy beach, playing in the rain, and touching the cool earth with our hands. Remind us to share these joys with others. Help us to make the most of opportunities to experience sanctified times of solitude or companionship while enjoying the peacefulness of nature. Help us to keep the Lord’s commandments to preserve the earth and care for all that is in it. Teach us to regularly do our part to respect and protect all living creatures as an act of love and gratitude to our Heavenly Father.

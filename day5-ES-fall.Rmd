## Reformed Theology: KINGDOM
.small[
*Matthew 6:10, Mark 1:14-15, Micah 6:8* 

* “The kingdom of God is the rule of God over all things. God is king. He is sovereign. He reigns...The kingdom is both a present and a future reality. It is “already now” and “not yet.” Jesus said the kingdom is at hand; he also prayed for the kingdom to come.” 
* “Closely related to an emphasis upon the kingdom is a commitment to seek justice in society...Christians construe God’s call to love as applying to the personal relationships Christians have with people within the communities in which they live; whereas justice is something that Christians can seek for all people everywhere.”

- What is "Evolutionary Optimism / The Myth of Progress"? (pp. 81-87)
- What does Wright mean by "Souls in Transit" (Platonic dualism / Gnosticism)? (pp. 88-91)
- Wright thinks *both* those ideas are **wrong**, so what does he think is *right*? He doesn't say much yet, but what can we say for now?

## Wright claims that Christian hope of the (physical, material) redemption and renewal of people and all creation strongly informs how we treat one another, and the earth. Matter *matters* and what exists now will be transformed, not destroyed or replaced.

## Prayers

.small[
>> to abet creation and to witness it, to notice each thing so each thing gets noticed. (-A. Dillard)

>> prays with... eyes open... an act of noticing, of reveling, of cultivating the attention that leads to devotion. (-E. Peterson, quoted by T. Harrison Warren)

# Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it. 
#(Proverbs 4:23)

# Philippians 1:9-11
And this is my prayer: That your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ - to the Glory and Praise of God.

# Your Quotes

1. You have a quote. Want it? Keep it...Else, swap.
2. Start writing notes about why you chose it. Informality and bullet points are fine.

## How can I serve God in my education? Work? Hobbies? Life?
